#' Oil sardine landings in metric tons by quarter
#'
#' A dataset containing the landings (in metric tons) of oil sardines in Kerala, Karnataka and Goa states 1956-2016.  The data are collected and processed into a total landings estimates based on a stratified sampling of landing sites along the SW coast of India throughout the year.  The program is run by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) in Cochin, India.  The data were obtained from reports published by CMFRI; see references.

#' Oceanic Nino Index and Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index
#'
#' @details
#' The ONI index is 3 month running mean of ERSST.v5 SST anomalies in the Ni√±o 3.4 region (5oN-5oS, 120o-170oW)], based on centered 30-year base periods updated every 5 years.  The ONI was downloaded as follows:

#' Precipitation data
#'
#' @description Three precipition datasets off the SW coast of India.  Two are satellite derived and one is based on land gauges.
#' 
#' @details
#' The National Climatic Data Center provides basic information on the GPCP Precipitation dataset.  The dataset consists of monthly precipitation estimates (average mm/day) from January 1979 to the present. The precipitation estimates merge several satellite and in situ sources into a final product. Data are provided on a 2.5 degree grid.  The GPCP Precipitation data are provided by the NOAA/NCEI Global Precipitation Climatology Project and were downloaded from \url{https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-precipitation-climatology-project-gpcp-monthly}.  Two boxes were defined, one off the Kerala coast and one off the Karnataka coast, and the average values of all grid points within these boxes were used.
#' \preformatted{
#' The boxes are 
#' Kerala Lat(8.75,  11.25), Lon(73.25,  75.75)
#' Karnataka Lat(13.75,  16.25), Lon(71.25,  73.75)
#' }
#' 
#' The land gauge data is monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall (in mm) area weighted average for each state in India starting from 1901 onwards. This data set is based on rain guages.  The data are provided by the India Meteorological Department (Ministry of Earth Sciences).  The 1901 to 2014 data were downloaded from the Open Government Data Platform India \url{https://data.gov.in}.  The raw data are in the file 'Area_Weighted_Monthly_Seasonal_And_Annual_Rainfall_0.csv' in the extdata folder.  The 2015 and 2016 data were extracted from the yearly Rainfall Statistics reports (see references).
#' 
#' NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) website provides background on the TRMM data (\url{https://pmm.nasa.gov/}).  1997 to 2015 monthly precipitation estimates on a 0.25 degree grid were downloaded from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) website.  The data are averaged in the 2.5 x 2.5 degree boxes used for the other satellite data.

#' India monsoon onset dates
#' 
#' @description
#' India monsoon onset dates relative to average June 1st arrival date into SW India.  
#'
#' @details
#' The onset dates were extracted from the annual monsoon reports.  These reports contain a section on the 'Onset and Advance of the Southwest Monsoon' which gives the date that the southwest monsoon set in over Kerala. The onset is given as the number of days before or after June 1st.  0 indicates that the monsoon arrived on June 1st.  1 would indicate that it arrived on June 2nd. -1 indicates it arrived on May 31.

#' Sea surface temperature data from remote-sensing products
#'
#' @description The SST satellite data were downloaded from the NOAA ERDDAP server using R Mendels
#' \code{rerddapXtracto} R package which uses the ropensci \code{rerddap} R package.  The R code used
#' to download the data is in the \code{extdata/get_satelite_data} folder.  See examples for how to find
#' the file.
#' 
#' @details
#' For 1981 to 2002, We used the Pathfinder Version 5.2
#'    (L3C) monthly day and night product on a 0.0417 degree grid.  These SST data use the Advanced Very-High Resolution
#'   Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument on the Pathfinder satellites.  These data were provided by GHRSST
#'   and the US National Oceanographic Data Center. This project
#'   was supported in part by a grant from the NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) Program for satellites.
#'    
#'    For 2003 to 2016, we used the NOAA CoastWatch sea surface temperature (SST) products 
#'    derived from NOAA's Polar Operational Environmental Satellites (POES). The SST estimates use the
#'    Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments on the POES satellites and are 
#'    on a 0.1 degree grid.  
#'    
#'    Both SST data sets were downloaded from the NOAA ERDDAP server. See

#'    The R code used
#' to download the data is in the \code{extdata/get_satelite_data} folder.  See examples
#'  for how to find and view the files.  The SST values were averaged across thirteen
